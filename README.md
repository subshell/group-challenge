# Group Challenge

[![Docker](https://github.com/subshell/group-challenge/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/subshell/group-challenge/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

An easy-to-use website to create submission-based challenges that will be evaluated together in real-time.
Any user is allowed to create challenges with a fixed start and end date while others join and
contribute. Currently supported challenges are:

- ðŸ“¸ **Photo Challenge**

## Local development

This project includes pre-configured configuration files to launch the api, frontend, and postgres in VS Code. Alternatively you can start all services with the following commands:

1. **Postgres:** start a postgres db at port `5432`.

```sh
  mkdir /tmp/group-challenge-cache
  docker-compose up
```

2. **API:** start the go api server at port `8080`.

```sh
  cd api && go run ./cmd/group-challenge/root.go
```

3. **Frontend:** start the frontend at port `3000`.

```sh
  cd frontend && npm start
```

## Run in Docker

The Dockerimage requires a config file `/app/config.yaml`. Env variables are also supported. They have a `GC_` prefix,
for example: `GC_SERVER_PORT`. The postgreSQL database is not part of the Dockerimage and has to be started separately.

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  staticFilesDir: "./static"
db:
  user: postgres
  password: postgres # prefered method: use env variable GC_DB_PASSWORD
  database: group_challenge
  host: "localhost:5432"
  poolSize: 50
  logQueries: false
challenges:
  liveParty:
    defaultTimePerSubmissionSeconds: 45
imgProxy:
  enabled: true
  url: "http://localhost:8081"
  localFilePath: "/tmp/group-challenge-cache"
  thumbnailQuality: 75
  fullSizeQuality: 75
```

### Kubernetes support

The helm chart is available under https://subshell.github.io/helm-charts-lab/

```sh
helm repo add subshell-public https://subshell.github.io/helm-charts-lab
helm install -f gc-values.yaml group-challenge subshell-public/group-challenge
```

This chart uses the [Bitnami Postgres Helm Chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql) as a dependency. Configure it with `postgresql` in your `values.yaml` file.
You definitely want to change the password using `global.postgresql.postgresqlPassword` or a secret. You have to install the `pgcrypto` extension manually.

2. Open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Image processing

To reduce the size of all uploaded images, we support [imgProxy](https://docs.imgproxy.net). See `imgProxy` for its configuration.
